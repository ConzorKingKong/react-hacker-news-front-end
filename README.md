# React Hacker News Front-end

[React Hacker News Front-end](https://hn.connorpeshek.me) is a front-end for Hacker News' public api. I mainly made it to show off my react abilities.

This project uses react, react-router, redux, express, and webpack among other technologies.

## How to use

For testing locally, run `npm run develop`. This will use `webpack-dev-server` to run a development version of the server locally.

Otherwise, run `npm start`
